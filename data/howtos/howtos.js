        date_created: "June 23, 2020",
        author: "BY MELANIE RADZICKI MCMANUS ",
        paragraphs: [
            "People often joke that anything can be fixed with a little duct tape. While duct tape can't fix everything, it's definitely a versatile product that can be used in innumerable ways.", 
            "Duct tape was created during World War II, when factory worker Vesta Stoudt discovered soldiers had a hard time opening the ammunition boxes she and her colleagues were sealing with paper tape, then dipping in wax. Stout penned a letter to President Franklin D. Roosevelt, proposing the war effort employ a cloth-backed, waterproof tape instead. Roosevelt agreed, and soon a Johnson & Johnson operating company was manufacturing the durable, easy-to-remove tape, colored Army green.",
             "The tape was crafted from a thin piece of duck fabric — a heavy, woven canvas — coupled with a plastic coating and rubber-based adhesive. Some say this new sealant had no name during the war, while others assert people began calling it duck tape after the duck fabric, or possibly because it resisted water, much like a duck's body.",
              "When the war ended, the construction industry began using the tape to patch together ventilation ductwork, and it soon became known as duct tape. Manufacturers quickly swapped out its original green color for silver tape that matched the ductwork.",
               "By the 1980s duct tape had gone mainstream and was found in many, if not most, U.S. households. Today, it's available in a wide assortment of materials and colors, and consumers have come up with all sorts of creative uses for it. Here are 10 of them.",
                "Protect blisters. If you develop blisters while walking, running or hiking, don't cover them with bandages. Those often come loose or fall off. Instead, clean any blisters thoroughly, then place a piece of gauze over them and top with duct tape. Trimming the corners will help ensure the tape stays in place when you pull on your socks. ",
                 "Trap bugs. Flies ruining your camping trip? Hang several foot-long strips of duct tape from the trees. The tape will act as flypaper, trapping the insects. This trick also works in your garage or on your patio. One duct tape fan reports catching crickets in his basement by laying strips on the basement floor sticky side up.", 
                 "Patch together glasses. Yes, duct taping your glasses together will make you look nerdy. But if your eyeglasses break and you can't replace them immediately, a little duct tape is all you need. Better to look nerdy than not be able to see. ",
                  "Keep snow out of your shoes. On a hike and need to cross a patch of deep snow? Wrap duct tape around the tops of your boots or shoes and the lower ends of your pants, creating faux gaiters that will keep the snow from falling into your footwear. You can employ a similar system if you have to wade through some muck that might pull off your shoes.",
                   "Remove splinters. If you have an exposed wood, fiberglass or metal splinter that's in a typical, easy-to-reach spot — e.g., your finger versus near your eye — place a piece of duct tape over it and then pull it out. Some recommend a gentle pulling back of the tape, while others say a quick yank is best.",
         "Help squeeze your toothpaste tube. When your toothpaste is nearly gone, it's a pain to keep rolling up the bottom of the tube to squeeze the last bits out. Instead, roll it up and hold it in place with some sturdy duct tape.", 
         "Employ as a drink holder. Don't want your sparkling water or soda to tip over? Then stick it in the center of a roll of duct tape. It's the perfect width and height to keep many drinks in place.", 
         "Make roses. Duct tape isn't just for emergency fixes or hacks. It can be used to create artwork and crafts. The Duck Brand, a popular duct tape manufacturer, offers tape in more than 200 different colors, prints and styles. Its website has instructions on crafting everything from daisy pens and notebook covers to a pot of roses, all with duct tape.", 
         "Hem clothing. Not handy with a needle and thread, or in a hurry? Hem those pants or skirts with some duct tape until you can get them properly repaired. Bonus: the duct tape should stay in place through a few washings.", 
         "Remove common warts. An old wives' tale says you can remove a wart by rubbing it on a church pew. A better idea: put a piece of duct tape over the wart and let sit for several days. Remove the tape, clean the area, then put on another piece. Most common warts will disappear within one month. This duct tape regimen proved significantly more effective at wart-removal than cryotherapy, according to a study in the Archives of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine.", "Bonus use: Help out on a lunar mission: One of the more impressive uses of duct tape came in 1970, during the famous Apollo 13 lunar mission that went awry. During the mission, two oxygen tanks exploded. The explosion forced the astronauts to move into the spacecraft's lunar module, where carbon dioxide levels rose precipitously. The crew used duct tape (among other items) to patch together a CO2 filtering system featuring an incompatible round hole and square filter.", "Despite duct tape's versatility, there are some things it can't do. Duct tape doesn't work as painting tape, for example. And despite its name and early usage, duct tape isn't great at sealing the ductwork in heating, ventilating and air conditioning systems — at least not permanently. The U.S. Department of Energy's Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory conducted a study of various duct sealants and only one failed: duct tape. The testers think the heat in HVAC systems degraded the tape glue." ],

On low speed, mix in the condensed milk, vanilla, and any flavorings. Pour into a resealable container, cover the surface with plastic wrap, then seal. Freeze for at least 6 hours, or until firm. Keep stored in the freezer.",
         "Freeze & Stir Method - In a large bowl, use an electric mixer to beat the milk and sugar until the sugar is dissolved, 1 to 2 minutes. Stir in the cream, vanilla, and salt until combined. If the mixture isn’t cold, place in the refrigerator until chilled, about 30 minutes.Place the mixture in a deep stainless steel baking dish and freeze for 45 minutes. As it begins to freeze near the edges, remove it from the freezer and stir vigorously with a spatula. Return to the freezer. Continue to check the mixture every 30 minutes, stirring vigorously as it’s freezing. If you have a hand held mixer or blender, use one of those. Repeat this process for 2 to 3 hours, or until frozen."

        title: "How to Write a Short Story",
        date_created: "July 24, 2019",
        author: "BY Bella Rose Pope",
        paragraphs: [ 
        "#1 – You learn the skill of showing - When you only have a few pages to hook readers, paint a clear picture of the character, and tell a story, you end up mastering the skill of showing instead of telling. The reason for this is because, in order to accomplish a successful and good short story, showing is a major part of that. It’s far too difficult to write a great short story without showing the details and using strong verbs to paint a clear image of your character’s life. Those skills will transfer into anything you write, automatically making it that much better.",
        "#2 You’ll strengthen individual chapters - No matter if you’re a fiction writer or if you prefer nonfiction, the idea here is the same. A chapter is basically a short story that’s a part of a bigger whole. The same skills you apply to write a great short story will also help you write stronger chapters. Each part of your book should be polished, strong, and enticing for your readers. Using short story writing methods will help you achieve that within your chapters. Why is writing good chapters important if there’s a whole book available for someone to read? Because it hooks readers and keeps them turning that page. And when readers look back on an entire book filled with incredible chapters, the entire book as a whole will be seen as being that much better.",
        "#3 It makes the story sections of your book more captivating - Every nonfiction book has portions where stories must be told in order to get the point across. This is what allows people to relate to you as an author, which pulls them in deeper and makes the core message of your book resonate with them more. But if those stories are weak, not well-written, and lackluster, it’s unlikely someone will enjoy them as much. It’s also likely that your message will get lost because the book doesn’t carry the same impact.",
        "How to Write a Short Story - #1 Focus on Character Development - In order for a short story to be impactful, you have to know your character well. Having good character development is essential in short stories, since your characters often drive the story. You only have a certain amount of time to show your readers who that person is and you can’t do that if you don’t even know who they are. Think about it. If you write a short story about your best friend, whom you’ve known for many years, versus writing one about someone you just met yesterday, you’ll be able to craft a much stronger story about your best friend because you know them so well. The same goes for your fictional characters. You don’t have to spend a ton of time on your main character, but know their history, age, personality, family life, friend life, love life, and other details that shape the way someone sees the world.",
        "#2 Outline - Thankfully, the outlining process for a short story is much easier than a full novel, but I do still advise creating one in order to have a cohesive flow throughout the story. This is definitely useful for those of you who prefer outlining versus just writing by the seat of your pants. Here’s what your outline should encompass for a short story: The point of view you’ll use,  How you’ll start the story, How you’ll get from the beginning to the main issue, What happens at the “climax” (yes, even short stories have one!), Resolution of the main issue, The very end. Keep in mind that your short story can end very abruptly or you can flesh it out until there’s a satisfying ending. This is really up to you as an author to decide.",
        "#3 Start with something out of the ordinary - In order to hook readers with a short story, you should start with something that’ll catch someone’s attention right off the bat. Take Hannah Lee Kidder’s example from the video above. One of the short stories in her anthology, Little Birds, opens with a woman collecting roadkill. Odd? Yes. Attention grabbing? You bet! Because we’re automatically intrigued by the fact that people don’t normally go around collecting roadkill. Now, you don’t have to start your short story with something as strange as that but you do want to give your readers a sense of who your character is by depicting something different right away that also has to do with the core focus of your short story.",
        "#4 Get the draft done ASAP - Done is better than perfect. We’ve all heard or read these words time and time again – and that’s because they’re important; they’re true. This is especially the case when it comes to short stories. Once you have your outline and know how to start writing, drafting the short story in full comes next. Don’t worry about editing or polishing the story up in any way right now. After all, you can’t possibly make good edits until you know what the story looks like in full. That would be like matching your earrings to your pants without first having the full outfit put together. You don’t know if those earrings work well with it until you see what else you’ll be wearing. It’s the same for writing. Focus on getting your draft done so you can move on to the next step",
        "#5 Edit your short story - Editing is where the real magic happens when it comes to writing. We all have this idea in our minds that we’ll get it perfect the first time and that’s just not how writing works. Most of the time, your first draft is just the bare bones of what’s to come but through line editing, developmental edits, and proofreading, it will transform into something better. Think of the actual writing as the wooden structure of a house and the editing as the drywall, paint, windows, light fixtures, doors, and anything else that’ll make the house complete. These are a few things to keep an eye out for when editing your short story: Point of view consistency, Tense consistency, Consistency with the setting of your story, Weak verbs (replace them with our list of strong verbs found right here!), Showing versus telling (readers need you to show more!), Stronger imagery, Spelling/grammar/dialogue. The editing process for short stories is pretty much the same for novels. The only difference is that short stories tend to focus more on imagery and exposition than they do full character and plot development. ",
        "#6 Title it! - This can be one of the most difficult things for any book, let alone a story that’s only a few hundred to a few thousand words. The good news? Short story titles are a little less important than titles for novels. They can also be very abstract. What you want to think of when titling your short story is this: What’s the overarching theme? What is something unique about the story? What sounds intriguing but not explanatory? What makes sense after reading the short story? These questions will help you develop a title that not only makes sense, but is also intriguing enough to pull readers in while staying true to what the story is about.",
        "#7 Get feedback - No matter how experienced (or inexperienced) you are as a writer, you need feedback. In order to learn and improve and ensure your message is coming across as desired, you need someone else’s fresh eyes on it. We need this help because the simple fact is, we’re too close to our writing. It’s impossible to read your story with a critical eye when you’re the one who came up with and wrote it in the first place. Allowing others to read your work and offer feedback is one of the best ways to improve and make sure your story is exactly how you want it.",
        "#8 Practice by writing short stories often - The number one best way to learn how to write good short stories is by writing them often. When you’re writing regularly, your brain falls into the habit of being creative and thinking in terms of short stories. The more you do it, the easier it will get and the more you’ll improve. So focus on writing a certain number of short stories per week and stick to that – even if they aren’t your favorite.",
        "#9 Write one short story every day for 30 days - This is separate from writing short stories often. If you really want to kickstart your progress and get really good quickly, then create a challenge for yourself. Write one short story, whether it’s 500 or 1,000 words, per day for an entire month. When you’re done, you’ll have 30 full short stories to review, edit, and improve upon. Doing this not only builds a habit, but it also gives you a lot of experience quickly. After those 30 days, you’ll know more about how you like to write short stories, which mean more to you, and how to write them to be good.",
        "#10 Focus on a single message - Short stories are known for being impactful even though they’re not novel-length. And that means they have to have a core theme or message you want to get across. This can be anything from loving yourself to ignoring societal expectations. In order to do this, think about what you want people to walk away from your story feeling. What is the desired outcome? If you just want people to enjoy the story, that’s great. However, what makes a story impactful and enjoyable is what readers take away from it. Brainstorm some themes that are important to you and work your short story around them. This will not only make you care about your story more (which means it’ll be written better), but it’ll also make it more satisfying for readers.",
        "#11 Tie it up with a satisfying ending - Nobody likes a story that ends on a major cliffhanger. It’s okay for your short story to have an unresolved ending. In fact, that’ll likely be the case simply because the story is…well, short. But you do want to tie your story up in a way that leaves the reader feeling satisfied even if they didn’t get all the answers. Many times, this means circling back to an idea or element presented in the beginning. This structure often allows readers to feel as though they’ve read a complete story versus just a snippet of a larger one.",

When an avalanche quakes the mountains in your character’s town, it unveils something that’s been hidden for…millenia.",
        "Tips for writing with short story ideas - Sometimes short story ideas are enough but if you want to utilize them effectively, keep these tips in mind: Keep it simple and focus on a single portion of a character’s life. Make sure the reader has a clear picture of your character right away. Focus on the theme and message you’re trying to get across. Let the short story idea create a life of its own. Be unique and think of many possible endings to the story before outlining. "

        author: "BY Miller Auto & Marine",
        paragraphs: [
        "1. Find a safe place to pull over - The ground should be solid and level to keep your car from rolling. If you’re on the side of the road, pull over as far as possible. Avoid stopping near any bends in the road, as this reduces visibility for both you and other drivers. If you’re in a dark or unsafe area, carefully drive to a better spot",
        "2. Use Your Hazard Lights and Parking Brake - Use your hazard lights and parking brake to keep yourself and your vehicle safe by increasing your visibility and decreasing the vehicle’s ability to roll.",
        "3. Check for Materials - At the bare minimum, you’ll need a jack, wrench, and a spare tire. These three items should always be in your vehicle just in case a flat tire occurs. Additional items that can make tire changing a little easier include: Flashlight, Gloves, Mat for kneeling, Rain poncho, Tire gauge, Your vehicle’s owner’s manual",
        "4. Loosen the Lug Nuts - If your vehicle has a wheel cover (also known as a hubcap), pry it off. Then, secure the wrench onto a lug nut, and turn it counterclockwise to loosen it. Repeat this process with each lug nut, making sure each one is loose enough to turn by hand.",
        "5. Lift Your Vehicle Off the Ground - Place the jack under the metal portion of your vehicle’s frame. Do not place the jack where it will have contact with any plastic molding. The best jack placement differs depending on the vehicle. Consulting your owner’s manual is the best way to learn proper jack placement. Once properly placed, use the jack to raise the tire you’re changing off of the ground. Ensure the jack stays perpendicular to the ground at all times." ,
        "6. Remove the Lug Nuts and the Tire - Turn the lug nuts counterclockwise until they are all very loose. Next, remove them completely. Keep the lug nuts all together in a safe spot, as you’ll need them to secure the replacement tire. With the lug nuts removed, there is nothing keeping your tire attached to the vehicle. Securely grip your tire and pull it directly toward your body. ",
        "7. Place the Spare Tire on the Car - Line up the holes in the spare with the lug nut posts and place the spare on the wheelbase. Push the spare as far onto the wheelbase as possible.", 
        "8. Replace the Lug Nuts - Put the lug nuts on so the spare tire stays put. Don’t tighten them all the way just yet. It’s very important to tighten your lug nuts in a way that keeps the tire even.", 
        "9. Lower Your Vehicle and Begin Tightening - Using the jack, slowly lower your vehicle until your spare tire starts touching the ground. This holds the tire in place as you begin tightening the lug nuts. Tighten the lug nuts in increments, alternating every-other nut. For example, if you assign a number to each lug nut, tighten in this order: 1, 3, 5, 2, 4, 1, 3, 5, 2, 4, and repeat. This way you’ll keep the tire on straight.",
        "10. Lower Your Vehicle Completely and Finish Tightening - Once the lug nuts feel equally tight, completely lower your vehicle to the ground. Once grounded, you may be able to tighten the lug nuts a little bit further. Continue your tightening in the same incremental order until they no longer budge.",
        "Extra Tips for How to Change a Tire - Finish up by putting your old tire in the trunk and cleaning up any tools you used. Depending on what’s wrong with it, your old tire might be salvageable. Bring it to a trusted mechanic who can test and possibly repair it. Otherwise, you’ll need to invest in a new spare, which should be done immediately. It’s never a good idea to operate a vehicle without a spare tire; make sure to pre-check your spare tire and parts to make sure it is ready to use in case of an emergency."],

        "Depending on your purchase, your ruler may measure in 1/8ths or 1/16ths (these are the number of little tick marks in between numbers), it's good to know which your ruler is. If you have doubts, start counting the tick marks between the 1 and the 2 (for inches). If you get higher than 8, your ruler goes by 16th's!", 
        "Now you're ready to measure. Line up the base of the ruler with the base of whatever it is you're measuring. Make sure the ruler is steady and won't be moving around, this is crucial for a close measurement.",
        "The last step to read a ruler measurement is to actually read the measurement! Count the highest whole number to the length of the object (so if the object goes past 7, but not to 8, stop at 7). After you read 7, every tick mark until you reach the length of the object. Your final measurement should be something like 7, and 3/8 inches. That wasn't so bad, was it? You might want to re-check the measurement just to make sure. Write down the measurement on a pad of paper so you don't forget it!"
